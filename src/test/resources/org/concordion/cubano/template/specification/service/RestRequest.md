# REST Request

As a test automation engineer
I need to call services
So that I can test them to destruction

## Acceptance Criteria
* Can call any service endpoint

## [Call httpbin endpoint testing service](-)
Given I know of a service 
When I call that service
Then I get a [result](- "c:assertTrue=callService()")
